# Covid_Portugal_Vaccine_Study

Portugal is one of the countries in the world where a large part of its population is fully vaccinated, ranking ninth with about 86% of the population vaccinated.
Despite this, the country reached in 2022 historic numbers of new cases of daily infections. Thus, through this study I intend to understand what the real impact that vaccination had in Portugal.



## Work Structure

This work will be divided in two main parts. The first part will be a descriptive analysis on the evolution of covid in Portugal, namely the evolution of new cases, deaths and vaccination. The seconde part will be the conclusion, where I analyze the relationship that vaccination has with the number of daily cases, the number of deaths, and the number of hospitalizations.
